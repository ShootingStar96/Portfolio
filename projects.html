      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/python/72c6e4685f" target="_blank">This project is a project that was hard to do. It took amny mistakes to complete it. Some challenges I faced while completing this project was trying to get the turtle to make perfect diamonds and a star in the middle. The first try was horrible. My diamonds were messy and didn't even look like diamonds. Every time teh star was being drawn, the star didn't even go in the middle but outside the diamonds. It took some time to get it right and I finally did.</a></span>
      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/python/7d4370f60d" taret="_blank">This project is a survey that I made. It's a series of random, funny questions I made up. I culd ask anything and you or someone else would answer. There really weren't any challenges making this survey. it was a straight forward assignment that I was able to do without any trouble.</a><span>
      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/python/0ba408ee87" target="_blank">This project is one of my personal favorites. My class was given an assignment to make on shape repeatedly to make something nice. I was doing the work and I made a mistake. This mistake was someone that was a successful mistake. My shape was better than everyone else's in my class. Challenges were faced in this such as the shape not being made right. It took very long to do but was worth it.</a><span>
